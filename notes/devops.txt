Create server on vultr, anything with ipv4 cuz idk, which costs $1/month extra

on your terminal: ssh root@address

ssh-keygen -t ed25519
vi the .pub and throw it in your github SSH settings (try right-clicking the terminal tab if you have trouble copying)

git clone the project
insert a godot exe from https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/ (it's too large to go on Github)
run the godot exe by calling its absolute path (possibly after calling chmod +x on it)

IMPORTANT:
for it to work, you may have to type "ufw allow 10567/udp" on the server
(or alternatively type that into /etc/ufw/before.rule)
and ufw status to confirm the ports are as they should be

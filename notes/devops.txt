Create server on vultr, anything with ipv4 cuz idk, which costs $1/month extra

on your terminal: ssh root@address

install git and zsh
here's a reasonable .zshrc:
"""
echo -e -n "\e[?17;14;224c"
PROMPT='%B%1~%b %F{009}$%f '
RPROMPT='%F{015}%T%f'
"""
to change the user password: sudo passwd root

ssh-keygen -t ed25519
DO NOT name the file, or change the ed25519, or your ssh agent won't be able to find it or somesuch
vi the .pub and throw it in your github SSH settings (cat and ctrl-shift-c for easy copying)

git clone the project
insert a godot exe from https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/ (it's too large to go on Github)
run the godot exe by calling its absolute path (possibly after calling "chmod -R 0777 *.*" on it) (remember to port forward)

IMPORTANT:
for it to work, you may have to type "ufw allow 10567/udp" on the server
(or alternatively type that into /etc/ufw/before.rule)
and ufw status to confirm the ports are as they should be

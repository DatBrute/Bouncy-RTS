Descending priority

RTS basics

Multiplayer does not exit gracefully from the client, 
the server must be restarted since it's still online
and it does not seem to destroy synced objects properly


We need a different lobby structure. 
With side, spectator, and switch side/spectator functionality.
Treating server as a spectator.

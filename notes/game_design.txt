Basically units have these stats:

Speed: Obvious
Climb speed: Speed when moving over enemy buildings, no such modifier on yours.
Size:  Has a variety of effects like HP and speed and range and damage and who you can eat. Limitless.
	If you are very big you eat instantly. Otherwise you bump and both go flying, dealing no direct damage.
Culture: Ticking effect that spreads your team's culture, which spreads automagically, 
	has some national effect but also: 
			slowly grows units
			instantly converts buildings
			collects from resource nodes (may require additional investment)
			allows building (but not uncancellable)
			deals DPS or maybe hard blocks only if in tower range
Range: Range at which you hit enemy units.
Wump ability: Channeled active with target circle, unique effect for each unit, cancelled by bump, 
	only possible at certain fixed size. Destroys buildings instantly.
Growth multiplier
Bump multiplier


May be a good idea to introduce cliffs that can be climbed/thrown off if the game has a knockback focus.
Maybe colors representing elements and units/nations have a home element and they merge together and make big boom.
Probably damage and maybe stun for hitting against buildings/units

Basically units have these stats:

Speed: Obvious
Climb speed: Speed when moving over enemy buildings, no such modifier on yours.
Size:  Has a variety of effects like HP and speed and range and damage and who you can eat. Limitless.
	If you are very big you eat instantly. Otherwise you bump and both go flying, dealing no direct damage.
Culture: Ticking effect that spreads your team's culture, which spreads automagically, 
	has some national effect but also: 
			slowly grows units
			instantly converts buildings
			collects from resource nodes (may require additional investment)
			allows building (but not uncancellable)
			deals DPS or maybe hard blocks only if in tower range
Range: Range at which you hit enemy units.
Wump ability: Channeled active with target circle, unique effect for each unit, cancelled by bump, 
	only possible at certain fixed size. Destroys buildings instantly.
Growth multiplier
Bump multiplier


May be a good idea to introduce cliffs that can be climbed/thrown off if the game has a knockback focus.
Maybe colors representing elements and units/nations have a home element and they merge together and make big boom.
Probably damage and maybe stun for hitting against buildings/units

Other ideas: (post-RTS-asset-HB-era):
- Every unit is a hero
- Units get bigger and stronger
- Boardable ships
	-crew fights until dead with no retreat
	-both are stunned
	- both can still take dmg from other ships
	- if ship destroyed crew auto-embarks but is damaged
		- abandon ship? auto-embark -> board?
- Ship eco: can only trade with other islands
- Limited movement at a time, possibly in TBS form
- No resources, only buildtime, tech web rather than tech tree
- Instanced timed arena fights or Klaxon pausing
- Advanced Nevsky-style supply
- everyone has creep-style auras, or maybe auras of different elements
- singing points for heroes, only 1 hero per, other units do nothing and it reveals you

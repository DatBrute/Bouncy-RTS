in multiplayer bomberman demo, the following will make the server playerless:
gamestate:121 comment it out
gamestate:122 set it to 0

Then to make it headless:
lobby:95 change to "gamestate.rpc("begin_game")" so that we can start as a player
Change gamestate.begin_game() to this:
	
	@rpc(any_peer)
	func begin_game():
		if(not multiplayer.is_server()):
			return
		rpc("load_world")

		var world ...

After that probably all you have to do is make it headless (and ensure it's not insanely buggy)
Ideally you'd have a meta-server with multiple rooms, but this is not necessary until the game is released
